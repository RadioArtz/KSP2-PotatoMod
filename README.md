## KSP2-PotatoMod
A mod aimed at improving performance. Unfortunately KSP2 seems to have some heavy underlying issues so this only brings minor improvements at major costs.
This mod was developed with [S P A C E  W A R P](https://github.com/X606/SpaceWarp), an open source modloader for KSP 2.

You can activate the mod by pressing spacebar once you've loaded into the KSC.

NOTE: This mod not only heavily reduces terrain complexity but also reduces the physics update rate so you might experience some issues on old saves.

Here's the KSC with the mod:
